# Flight delays analysis
The aim of the project is to analyse delays of the US domestic flights using the R language. 
Since depature delays are on average longer than arrival delays and generate higher costs, the target variable describes departure delays. The flight is considered to be delayed if the difference between actual and schedulled time of depature was higher than 15 minutes.
